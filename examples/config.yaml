    output_denom_osmosis: uosmo # the output denom of the trade, as represented on osmosis. For e.g. USDC, this will start with ibc/
    output_denom_origin: ibc/something # the output denom of the trade, as represented on the origin chain. If funds stay on Osmosis this is not used.

# This configuration is important. It is used to recover funds on Osmosis in the event an unanticipated failure occurs.
